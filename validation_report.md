# Story 1.6: Campaign Transcript Logging â€” DoD Checklist Review

## 1. Requirements Met

- [x] All functional requirements specified in the story are implemented.
  - Logging mechanism writes to `data/saves/[campaign_save_id]/transcript.log`.
  - Player messages and AI responses are appended with author, timestamp, and content.
  - Log entry structure is specified and enforced.
- [x] All acceptance criteria defined in the story are met.
  - Each acceptance criterion is addressed in implementation and changelog.

## 2. Coding Standards & Project Structure

- [x] All new/modified code strictly adheres to Operational Guidelines.
- [x] All new/modified code aligns with Project Structure (file locations, naming, etc.).
- [x] Adherence to Tech Stack for technologies/versions used (Python 3.13, FastAPI).
- [x] Adherence to Api Reference and Data Models (uses campaign_id, structure matches data model).
- [x] Basic security best practices applied (input validation for campaign_id, error handling, no hardcoded secrets).
- [x] No new linter errors or warnings introduced (per story notes).
- [x] Code is well-commented where necessary (per dev notes and code docstrings).

## 3. Testing

- [x] All required unit tests as per the story and Operational Guidelines Testing Strategy are implemented.
- [x] All required integration tests as per the story and Operational Guidelines Testing Strategy are implemented.
- [x] All tests (unit, integration) pass successfully.
- [x] Test coverage meets project standards (comprehensive coverage per changelog and dev notes).

## 4. Functionality & Verification

- [x] Functionality has been manually verified by the developer (per dev agent record and changelog).
- [x] Edge cases and potential error conditions considered and handled gracefully (invalid campaign_id, file I/O errors).

## 5. Story Administration

- [x] All tasks within the story file are marked as complete.
- [x] Any clarifications or decisions made during development are documented in the story file or linked appropriately.
- [x] The story wrap up section has been completed with notes of changes, agent model, and changelog.

## 6. Dependencies, Build & Configuration

- [x] Project builds successfully without errors.
- [x] Project linting passes.
- [x] No new dependencies added (logging implemented with standard library and project utilities).
- [x] No known security vulnerabilities introduced.
- [x] No new environment variables or configurations introduced.

## 7. Documentation (If Applicable)

- [x] Relevant inline code documentation for new public APIs or complex logic is complete.
- [x] User-facing documentation not required (backend feature).
- [x] Technical documentation updated (story file, dev notes, changelog).

## Final Confirmation

- [x] I, the Reviewer, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed.
