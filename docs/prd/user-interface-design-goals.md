# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The core UX vision is to create an accessible and deeply immersive D&D experience by minimizing traditional UI complexity. The interface should feel like a natural conversation with a skilled Dungeon Master. The user should feel empowered and unconstrained, with the technology fading into the background to let the story shine.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
The MVP will support two primary, seamlessly integrated interaction paradigms within the Discord platform:
* **Voice-First Interaction:** Users should be able to speak their actions and decisions naturally. The AI will respond with a generated voice narrative.
* **Text-Based Interaction:** A complete and robust text interface for users who prefer to type, for playing in quiet environments, or for reviewing logs.

### Core Screens and Views
Within the context of a Discord bot, "screens" are the primary bot responses and interaction points:
* **Game/Session Management:** Commands and responses for starting a new campaign, loading a saved one, and ending a session.
* **Main Gameplay View:** The primary channel view where the AI's narrative descriptions, generated images, and player actions are displayed.
* **Character Sheet View:** A response to a `/sheet` command, showing a concise, easy-to-read summary of the player's character sheet.
* **Getting Started & Cost Info:** The output of the `/help` and `/cost` commands, providing clear onboarding instructions and transparent cost information.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
To align with the project's core goal of making D&D more accessible, the interface will adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards where applicable, ensuring text contrast, clear language, and usability for players with disabilities.

### Branding
*(To Be Defined)* - The visual identity, personality, and branding for the AI DM have not yet been defined.

### Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform
The MVP will be a Discord bot, which is inherently cross-platform and available on Desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) and Mobile (iOS, Android).
