# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
* To launch a functional, open-source AI-DM engine as an MVP within **3 months** to build a community and gather feedback.
* To establish a platform that can support a future marketplace for original, premium campaign modules.
* To validate the "Bring Your Own Key" model as a sustainable way to manage operational costs for advanced users.
* To create an engaging and immersive D&D experience that supports long, multi-hour sessions and encourages players to return to their campaigns.
* To deliver an AI capable of "Guided Improvisation," balancing player freedom with narrative progression to create a truly authentic TTRPG experience.

### Background Context
The popularity of Dungeons & Dragons is at an all-time high, but the "Dungeon Master bottleneck"—the scarcity of skilled and available DMs—prevents many aspiring players from participating. Existing digital solutions like video games lack the true freedom of a TTRPG, while virtual tabletops still require a human DM.

This project aims to solve that problem by creating a sophisticated AI-DM. The initial MVP will be a Discord bot leveraging the D&D 5.1 SRD ruleset. It will address the primary user adoption risks of cost and complexity through a carefully designed strategy involving transparent cost estimates and simplified pricing metrics, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience for all user types.
