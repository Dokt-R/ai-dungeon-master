# Story 1.7 - Campaign & Party Lifecycle Management

## Status
Review

## Story
**As a** server owner or player,  
**I want** clear, consolidated commands to create, join, continue, end, and delete a campaign,  
**so that** I can easily manage my game sessions from a single command group.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A user can create a new campaign using `/campaign new "[name]"`.
2. The bot provides instructions for other players to join using `/campaign join "[name]"`.
3. A user can resume the last played campaign using `/campaign continue`. The bot responds with the narrative from the last "clean save point".
4. Upon starting or continuing a campaign, the bot **must** display the message: "**Entering immersive role-playing mode. All messages from now on will be processed by the AI.**"
5. A user can end the current session using `/campaign end`. This triggers a final autosave.
6. Upon ending a campaign, the bot **must** display the message: "**Exiting immersive mode. Progress has been saved. You are now in command mode.**"
7. A user can delete a campaign using `/campaign delete "[name]"`, which will only proceed after the user confirms the action.
8. The bot responds to `/help` with a list of help topics (e.g., Campaign, Setup).
9. The bot responds to `/help <topic>` with detailed information for that topic.
10. After campaign creation or join, the bot guides the user through character setup (digital or physical sheet).
11. If a user disconnects unexpectedly, `/campaign continue` restores the last autosave without loss of progress.
12. Multiple players can join a campaign and register their characters, forming a party ready for gameplay.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement `/campaign new [name]` command in `campaign_cog.py` to create a new campaign and persist it in `data/campaigns/[campaign_name]/`. After creation, prompt the user for character setup (digital or physical sheet).
  (AC: 1, 10)
- [x] Implement `/campaign join [name]` command to allow players to join an existing campaign. Prompt for character setup.
  (AC: 2, 10, 12)
- [x] Implement `/campaign continue` command to resume the last active campaign and load the last clean save point. If user was disconnected, restore from autosave.
  (AC: 3, 11)
- [x] Display explicit state transition message on campaign start/continue.
  (AC: 4)
- [x] Implement `/campaign end` command to autosave and end the current session.
  (AC: 5)
- [x] Display explicit state transition message on campaign end.
  (AC: 6)
- [x] Implement `/campaign delete [name]` command with confirmation prompt.  
  (AC: 7)
- [x] Refactor `/help` command to list help topics and implement `/help campaign` and `/help setup`.
  (AC: 8, 9)
- [x] Write unit tests for all new commands and backend logic using Pytest.
- [ ] Write integration tests to verify end-to-end campaign lifecycle flows, including autosave/restore and character onboarding.

## Dev Notes

- **Discord Permission Handling**:
  - All `/campaign` commands must enforce Discord permission checks. Only users with the required Discord roles (e.g., Manage Server, Administrator) or the campaign owner may perform sensitive actions such as deleting a campaign. Permission checks should be implemented at the command level using discord.py's built-in decorators and custom logic as needed.
  - [See: Security Considerations section]

- **User Flow & Sequence Diagrams for Contributors**:
  - For detailed user flows and sequence diagrams, see [docs/ui-ux-specification/user-flows.md](../ui-ux-specification/user-flows.md).
    - Relevant diagrams:
      - Flow: New Campaign & Character Creation
      - Flow: Forming a Campaign Party
      - Edge Cases & Error Handling
  - New contributors should review these diagrams to understand the expected user experience and system interactions.

- **Previous Story Insights**:
  - Campaign transcript logging is robust, modular, and follows best practices for async file I/O, error handling, and code organization. The separation between logging utility and message processing logic is clear. All log entries are structured as required, and the code is readable, maintainable, and well-tested.

- **Data Models**:
  - `Campaign` model:
    - `campaign_id: str`
    - `server_id: str`
    - `name: str`
    - `active_player_ids: List[str]`
    - [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Campaign]
  - `PlayerCharacter` model:
    - `character_id: str`
    - `player_discord_id: str`
    - `campaign_id: str`
    - `name: str`
    - [Source: architecture/data-models.md#PlayerCharacter]

- **API Specifications**:
  - Server configuration API (for campaign-related settings) is implemented in FastAPI at `/servers/{server_id}/config` (PUT).
  - Uses Pydantic models for validation and error handling.
  - [Source: packages/backend/api/server_config.py]
  - No specific campaign management endpoints are defined; campaign logic is handled via bot commands and backend components.
  - [Source: architecture/index.md#API Specification]

- **Component Specifications**:
  - `CampaignManager`: Handles logic for creating, starting, ending, and deleting campaigns.
  - `PlayerManager`: Manages players joining a campaign and their associated character data.
  - `ServerSettingsManager`: Manages configuration for each Discord server.
  - [Source: architecture/components.md]
  - Discord bot commands should be implemented using the Cogs pattern in `packages/bot/cogs/campaign_cog.py`.
  - [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#bot/cogs]

- **File Locations**:
  - Campaign logic: `packages/backend/components/campaign_manager.py`
  - Player management: `packages/backend/components/player_manager.py`
  - Discord bot commands: `packages/bot/cogs/campaign_cog.py`
  - Help command logic: `packages/bot/cogs/utility_cog.py`
  - Campaign data: `data/campaigns/[campaign_name]/`
  - [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

- **Testing Requirements**:
  - All new code must be covered by unit tests using Pytest.
  - Test files should be placed in `packages/backend/tests/` and `packages/bot/tests/`.
  - Integration tests should verify campaign creation, joining, continuation, ending, and deletion flows, including autosave/restore and character onboarding.
  - At least two Discord users: one with campaign owner or server admin permissions, and one regular player.
  - Distinct campaign names for creation, joining, and deletion scenarios.
  - Character data for onboarding flows (digital or physical sheet).
  - Test Discord server with the bot installed and required permissions granted (manage channels, manage messages, etc.).
  - Ensure test users have appropriate Discord roles to execute campaign commands.
  - [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
  - [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md#Test Strategy]

- **Technical Constraints**:
  - Use Python 3.13, FastAPI for backend, discord.py for bot.
  - All code must be formatted with Black and linted with Ruff.
  - Use Pydantic models for all input validation.
  - All bot commands must use the tree command structure for Discord visibility.
  - [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/key-strategies.md]
  - All data access must go through the appropriate abstraction layers (e.g., MemoryService).
  - [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md#Use the Abstraction Layers]
  - Explicit state transition messages must be shown on campaign start/continue and end, as per UX spec.
  - [Source: ui-ux-specification/transitions.md]

- **Command Structure & UX**:
  - `/campaign` commands: new, join, continue, end, delete (with confirmation).
  - `/help` and `/help <topic>` commands for user guidance.
  - [Source: ui-ux-specification/command-structure.md]
  - Explicit state transition messages:
    - On entry: "**Entering immersive role-playing mode. All messages from now on will be processed by the AI.**"
    - On exit: "**Exiting immersive mode. Progress has been saved. You are now in command mode.**"
    - [Source: ui-ux-specification/transitions.md]
  - After `/campaign new` or `/campaign join`, the bot must guide the user through character setup (digital or physical sheet).
    - [Source: ui-ux-specification/user-flows.md#Flow: New Campaign & Character Creation, #Flow: Forming a Campaign Party]
  - If a user disconnects, `/campaign continue` restores the last autosave.
    - [Source: ui-ux-specification/user-flows.md#Edge Cases & Error Handling]
  - Party formation: multiple users can join and register characters, with onboarding prompts.
    - [Source: ui-ux-specification/user-flows.md#Flow: Forming a Campaign Party]

- **Security Considerations**
  - Only authorized users (the campaign owner or a server admin) may delete campaigns.
    - The `/campaign delete` command must enforce this restriction and validate the user's permissions before proceeding with deletion.
  - All campaign management commands should check for appropriate Discord permissions (e.g., Manage Server, Administrator) as required by server policy.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-05
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation is robust, modular, and follows best practices for async I/O, error handling, and code organization. All core campaign and party lifecycle commands are implemented with clear separation of concerns between bot, backend, and data layers. Permission checks for sensitive actions (e.g., campaign deletion) are enforced. Code is readable, maintainable, and well-documented. No major refactoring required at this stage.

### Refactoring Performed
- No direct code changes were necessary. The codebase is clean and follows project standards. The following improvements are recommended for the next iteration:
  - Implement a dedicated campaign info endpoint in the backend for permission checks (currently a workaround is used).
  - Replace TODOs with production logic for character sheet handling.
  - Complete integration tests for end-to-end campaign lifecycle flows.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Code is formatted with Black, linted with Ruff, and uses type hints and docstrings.
- Project Structure: ✓ All files are in correct locations per unified project structure.
