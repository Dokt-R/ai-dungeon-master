# Story 1.3: Secure Server API Key Storage

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system,  
**I want** to securely store and retrieve a single, server-wide API key,  
**so that** all interactions on a given server are powered by the key provided by the server owner.

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)
1. A storage mechanism is created for **server-to-API-key** mapping.
2. API keys are encrypted at rest in the storage mechanism.
3. The backend has a secure method to write a new key for a specific Discord **server ID**.
4. The backend has a secure method to retrieve a decrypted key associated with a specific Discord **server ID**.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement the `ServerConfig` Pydantic model with `server_id` and `api_key` fields.  
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- [ ] Extend the SQLite schema to include a table for server-to-API-key mapping, ensuring encryption at rest.  
  [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- [ ] Implement secure write and retrieve methods in the backend, using the `MemoryService` abstraction layer.  
  [Source: architecture/components.md, architecture/key-strategies.md]
- [ ] Ensure all secrets are managed via environment variables and never hardcoded.  
  [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md]
- [ ] Validate all inputs using Pydantic models.  
  [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md]
- [ ] Place backend logic in `packages/backend/` and ensure all data access goes through `MemoryService`.  
  [Source: architecture/source-tree.md, architecture/components.md]
- [ ] Write unit tests for secure storage and retrieval of API keys using Pytest.  
  [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md, architecture/tech-stack.md]
- [ ] Document the storage and retrieval process in the README.

## Dev Notes

- **Previous Story Insights**:  
  - Monorepo structure with separate modules and saves.  
    [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]  
  - Coding standards: Black for formatting, Ruff for linting, PEP 8 style guide.  
    [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md]  
  - Use abstraction layers for data access; direct DB calls forbidden.  
    [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md]  
  - Use Pytest for unit and integration tests.  
    [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md]

- **Data Models**:  
  - Use the `ServerConfig` Pydantic model:  
    ```python
    class ServerConfig(BaseModel):
        server_id: str
        api_key: SecretStr
        dm_roll_visibility: Literal['public', 'hidden']
        player_roll_mode: Literal['manual_physical_total', 'manual_physical_raw', 'manual_digital', 'auto_visible', 'auto_hidden']
        character_sheet_mode: Literal['digital_sheet', 'physical_sheet']
    ```
    [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

- **API Specifications**:  
  - Not applicable for this story.  
    [No specific guidance found in architecture docs]

- **Component Specifications**:  
  - Use `ServerSettingsManager` to manage server configuration.  
    [Source: architecture/components.md]  
  - Use `MemoryService` for all persistence operations.  
    [Source: architecture/components.md]

- **File Locations**:  
  - Place backend logic in `packages/backend/`.  
    [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]  
  - Data is stored in `data/srd_database.sqlite`.  
    [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

- **Testing Requirements**:  
  - Use Pytest for all tests.  
    [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md, architecture/tech-stack.md]  
  - Test files should be located alongside backend code or in a dedicated tests directory within `packages/backend/`.

- **Technical Constraints**:  
  - Use Python 3.11.  
    [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]  
  - All code must include type hints.  
    [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md]  
  - All secrets must be managed via environment variables.  
    [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md]  
  - Adhere to security best practices: input validation, no hardcoded secrets, encryption at rest.  
    [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md]

- **Project Structure Notes**:  
  - Unified project structure is defined in `source-tree.md`.  
    [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

## Testing

- All new code must be covered by unit tests using Pytest.
- Test files should be placed in `packages/backend/tests/` or alongside the relevant backend code.
- Ensure tests validate secure storage and retrieval of API keys.
- Follow PEP 8 and Black formatting for all test code.
