### Story 1.6: Campaign Transcript Logging

**Status:** InProgress

**As a** developer and future campaign host, **I want** every in-character player message and AI response to be saved to a persistent `transcript.log` file, **so that** I have a complete record for debugging and future summarization features.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. A logging mechanism is created that can write to a file specific to the active campaign (e.g., `data/saves/[campaign_save_id]/transcript.log`).
2. When a player sends a message that is processed as an in-game action, the message content and its author are appended to the log.
3. When the AI generates a narrative response, that response is appended to the log.
4. Each log entry should be structured (e.g., with a timestamp, author, and message content) for easy parsing.

#### Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:**  
No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

**Data Models:**  
- The `Campaign` model (see `docs/architecture/data-models.md`) includes `campaign_id`, which should be used to determine the log file path for each campaign.  
  `[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Campaign]`
- Player and AI messages are not explicitly modeled, but should be associated with a campaign and include author and content fields.  
  `[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Campaign]`

**API Specifications:**  
No specific API endpoints for logging are defined. Logging should be handled internally by the bot/backend.  
`[Source: architecture/index.md#API Specification]`

**Component Specifications:**  
- Logging should be implemented as a backend component or utility, ensuring that all in-character player messages and AI responses are captured.  
  `[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#backend/components]`

**File Locations:**  
- Log files should be stored at: `data/saves/[campaign_save_id]/transcript.log`  
  `[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#data]`
- Logging logic should reside in the backend or shared package, as appropriate.  
  `[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#backend, #shared]`

**Testing Requirements:**  
- Unit tests for the logging mechanism must be implemented using Pytest and placed in `packages/backend/tests/` or `packages/shared/tests/`.  
  `[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Unit Tests]`
- Integration tests should verify that logs are written correctly during campaign play.  
  `[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Integration Tests]`

**Technical Constraints:**  
- Use Python 3.13 and FastAPI for backend logic.  
  `[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Backend Language, #Backend Framework]`
- Data persistence should use the polyglot approach: log files as plain text or structured (e.g., JSONL) in the specified directory.  
  `[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Data Persistence]`
- Ensure log file writing is robust and does not block main gameplay logic.  
  `[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Backend Framework]`
- No specific security or performance constraints for logging, but log file access should be restricted to the server process.  
  `[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#data]`

#### Tasks / Subtasks

1. Implement a logging utility/component that writes to `data/saves/[campaign_save_id]/transcript.log`.  
   `[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#data, #backend/components]` (AC: 1)
2. Update the message processing logic to append each in-character player message (with author and timestamp) to the log.  
   `[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Campaign]` (AC: 2)
3. Update the AI response generation logic to append each narrative response (with timestamp) to the log.  
   `[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Campaign]` (AC: 3)
4. Ensure each log entry is structured with timestamp, author, and message content (e.g., as JSON or tab-separated values).  
   `[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Campaign]` (AC: 4)
5. Write unit tests for the logging utility/component using Pytest.  
   `[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Unit Tests]`
6. Write integration tests to verify that logs are written during campaign play.  
   `[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Integration Tests]`

#### Project Structure Notes

- The log file path and naming must align with the unified project structure: `data/saves/[campaign_save_id]/transcript.log`.
- Logging logic should be placed in the backend or shared package, not in the bot gateway.
- No structural conflicts identified.

---
#### Testing

- All new code must be covered by unit tests using Pytest.
- Test files should be placed in `packages/backend/tests/` or `packages/shared/tests/`.
- Ensure tests validate log writing, message content, and error handling.
- Follow PEP 8 and Black formatting for all test code.
- Integration tests should verify that logs are written correctly during campaign play.
- Follow guidance in `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`.

#### Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Logging could impact performance or cause file write errors if not handled asynchronously.
- **Mitigation:** Use non-blocking file I/O and robust error handling.
- **Rollback:** Disable logging and remove log file if issues occur.

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns (N/A for backend logging)
- [x] Performance impact is negligible

#### Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**
- [x] Story can be completed in one development session
- [x] Integration approach is straightforward
- [x] Follows existing patterns exactly
- [x] No design or architecture work required

**Clarity Check:**
- [x] Story requirements are unambiguous
- [x] Integration points are clearly specified
- [x] Success criteria are testable
- [x] Rollback approach is simple
