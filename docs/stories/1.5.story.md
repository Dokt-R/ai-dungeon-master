# Story 1.5: Getting Started Guide and Cost Transparency Command

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** new server owner or user,  
**I want** clear, accessible onboarding instructions and transparent information about API usage costs,  
**so that** I can confidently set up the bot and understand the implications of the BYOK model before committing.

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)
1. The bot provides a `/getting-started` command that returns a concise, step-by-step onboarding guide tailored for both server owners and regular users.
2. The onboarding guide includes:
   - How to invite the bot
   - How to set up the server API key (BYOK)
   - How to start a campaign
   - Where to find help and documentation (including the `/help` command)
3. The bot provides a `/cost` command that returns up-to-date, transparent information about average API usage costs, including a link to detailed documentation.
4. The `/cost` command is available to all users and does not expose any sensitive information.
5. The bot provides a `/help` command that lists all available commands, with a brief description for each, and references where to find more detailed help (e.g., `.roo/commands/`).
6. The `/help` command references other commands such as `/server-config` (for setup help) and `/cost` (for cost info).
7. All commands return ephemeral messages by default to avoid channel clutter.
8. The onboarding guide, help, and cost information are consistent with the latest documentation and project requirements.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement `/getting-started` command to deliver a step-by-step onboarding guide.
  [Source: prd/epic-1-core-bot-platform-user-onboarding.md, prd/requirements.md#FR8]
- [ ] Implement `/cost` command to provide cost transparency and link to documentation.
  [Source: prd/requirements.md#FR8]
- [ ] Implement `/help` command to list all available commands, provide brief descriptions, and reference advanced help locations (e.g., `.roo/commands/`).
  [Source: user feedback, best practices]
- [ ] Ensure all commands return ephemeral messages by default.
  [Source: ui-ux-specification/user-flows.md]
- [ ] Sync onboarding guide, help, and cost info with latest docs.
  [Source: prd/requirements.md, README.MD]
- [ ] Write unit tests for all commands, covering permission checks, message content, and error handling.
  [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- [ ] Document the new commands and their usage in the README.

## Dev Notes

- **Previous Story Insights**:  
  - Server key onboarding and secure command flow are complete.  
    [Source: docs/stories/1.4.story.md]
  - Error handling logic is centralized in `packages/shared/error_handler.py`.
  - All commands should use type hints and follow PEP 8/Black formatting.
- **User Experience**:
  - The onboarding guide should be concise, actionable, and link to further help.
  - The `/help` command should be the primary entry point for users to discover all available commands, with each command briefly described and references to more detailed help (e.g., `.roo/commands/`).
  - The `/help` command should mention `/server-config` (for setup) and `/cost` (for cost info) as examples.
  - Cost info should be clear, with real-world examples and a link to the full cost breakdown.
- **Technical Constraints**:  
  - Use Python 3.11.
  - All secrets managed via environment variables.
  - No sensitive data exposed in cost or onboarding messages.
- **File Locations**:  
  - Place bot command logic in `packages/bot/`.
  - Place tests in `packages/bot/tests/`.
- **Testing Requirements**:  
  - Use Pytest for all tests.
  - Test files should be located alongside bot code or in a dedicated tests directory.
  - Follow guidance in `architecture/testing-strategy.md`.
- **Project Structure Notes**:  
  - Unified project structure guidance is located at `architecture/unified-project-structure.md`.
  - Follow the source tree as defined in `architecture/source-tree.md`.

## Testing

- All new code must be covered by unit tests using Pytest.
- Test files should be placed in `packages/bot/tests/`.
- Ensure tests validate message content, permission checks, and error handling.
- Follow PEP 8 and Black formatting for all test code.

> Note: This story continues the onboarding and transparency focus, ensuring new users have the information they need to get started and understand costs before using the platform.
> The addition of a `/help` command as a central source for all command information further improves discoverability and user experience, and will serve as the dictionary for all other commands.
