# Story 1.2: Basic Discord Bot Integration

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** server owner,  
**I want** to be able to invite the AI DM bot to my server and see it come online,  
**so that** I can confirm the basic integration is working.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The Discord bot application is created in the Discord developer portal.
2. The bot can be successfully invited to a Discord server using a standard OAuth2 URL.
3. The bot appears with an "online" status in the server's member list.
4. The bot responds to a simple `/ping` command with "pong" in the channel where it was invoked.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create a Discord bot application in the Discord developer portal (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement OAuth2 invite URL generation and documentation (AC: 2)
- [ ] Integrate the bot with the Discord server using discord.py (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Ensure the bot appears online in the server member list (AC: 3)
- [ ] Implement `/ping` command using discord.py (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Respond with "pong" in the invoking channel (AC: 4)
- [ ] Write unit tests for bot startup and `/ping` command (AC: 4)
- [ ] Update README with bot invite and usage instructions (AC: 2, 4)

## Dev Notes

- **Previous Story Insights**: 
  - Project uses a monorepo structure with separate modules and saves. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
  - Coding standards: Black for formatting, Ruff for linting, PEP 8 style guide. [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md]
  - Use abstraction layers for data access; direct DB calls forbidden. [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md]
  - Use Pytest for unit and integration tests. [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md]

- **Data Models**: 
  - No specific data models required for this story. [No specific guidance found in architecture docs]

- **API Specifications**: 
  - Not applicable; this story focuses on bot integration, not API endpoints. [No specific guidance found in architecture docs]

- **Component Specifications**: 
  - Use `ServerSettingsManager` for server configuration if needed in future stories. [Source: architecture/components.md]
  - Use `NotificationService` for sending responses to channels. [Source: architecture/components.md]
  - Use `AIOrchestrator` for future AI interactions (not required for this story). [Source: architecture/components.md]

- **File Locations**: 
  - Place bot code in `packages/bot/`. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
  - Shared logic should go in `packages/shared/` if needed. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

- **Testing Requirements**: 
  - Use Pytest for all tests. [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md]
  - Test files should be located alongside the bot code or in a dedicated tests directory within `packages/bot/`. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
  - Ensure tests cover bot startup and `/ping` command.

- **Technical Constraints**: 
  - Use discord.py v2.3.2 for bot integration. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
  - Python 3.11 required. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
  - All code must include type hints. [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md]
  - All secrets (e.g., bot token) must be managed via environment variables. [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md]
  - Adhere to security best practices: input validation, no hardcoded secrets. [Source: architecture/key-strategies.md]

- **Project Structure Notes**: 
  - Unified project structure document (unified-project-structure.md) is missing; structure inferred from source-tree.md and previous story.

## Testing

- All new code must be covered by unit tests using Pytest.
- Test files should be placed in `packages/bot/tests/` or alongside the relevant bot code.
- Ensure tests validate bot startup and `/ping` command response.
- Follow PEP 8 and Black formatting for all test code.
