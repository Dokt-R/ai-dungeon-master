## Story Statement
As a developer, I want to create the initial story for the first epic to set the foundation for future development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The story must adhere to the project's coding standards and architecture guidelines.
- The story should include a clear statement, acceptance criteria, and technical context.

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights**: No previous stories exist.
- **Data Models**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.
- **API Specifications**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.
- **Component Specifications**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.
- **File Locations**: Follow the monorepo structure as outlined in the source tree.
- **Testing Requirements**: Use Pytest for unit and integration tests.
- **Technical Constraints**: Adhere to coding standards and use abstraction layers for data access.

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. Set up the initial project structure following the source tree guidelines.
2. Implement basic error handling and logging as per key strategies.
3. Ensure all code adheres to the coding standards.
4. Write unit tests using Pytest.

## Project Structure Notes
- The project will use a monorepo structure with separate modules and saves.
