# Story 1.4: Server Key Onboarding Command Flow

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** server owner,  
**I want** simple commands to set up a shared API key for my server,  
**so that** all members can participate in campaigns using my key.

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)
1. The bot responds to a `/server-setup` command with a message explaining the shared API key model and how to submit a key.
2. The `/server-setup` and `/server-setkey` commands can only be successfully run by users with "Administrator" or "Manage Server" permissions.
3. The bot has a command (e.g., `/server-setkey [API_KEY]`) that accepts the owner's key.
4. When a key is submitted, the bot securely saves it for the entire server using the functionality from Story 1.3.
5. The submitted API key is successfully persisted in the ServerConfig database table for the corresponding server_id.
6. The bot provides a confirmation message upon successful key submission and an error for failures.
7. The owner's submitted key is not visible to other users in the channel.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement `/server-setup` command to explain the shared API key model and submission process.  
  [Source: prd/epic-1-core-bot-platform-user-onboarding.md#story-1.4]
- [x] Restrict `/server-setup` and `/server-setkey` commands to users with "Administrator" or "Manage Server" permissions.  
  [Source: prd/epic-1-core-bot-platform-user-onboarding.md#story-1.4]
- [x] Implement `/server-setkey [API_KEY]` command to accept and process the owner's key.  
  [Source: prd/epic-1-core-bot-platform-user-onboarding.md#story-1.4]
- [x] Integrate with backend to securely store the API key using the ServerConfig model, database table and ServerSettingsManager.
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md, architecture/components.md]
- [x] Ensure the key is encrypted at rest and never exposed in logs or messages.  
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md, architecture/components.md]
- [x] Provide confirmation and error messages for key submission.  
  [Source: prd/epic-1-core-bot-platform-user-onboarding.md#story-1.4]
- [x] Ensure the submitted key is not visible to other users in the channel.  
  [Source: prd/epic-1-core-bot-platform-user-onboarding.md#story-1.4]
- [x] Write unit tests for all command logic and backend integration.  
  [No specific guidance found in architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- [x] Document the command flow and security considerations in the README.

## Dev Notes

- **Previous Story Insights**:  
  - Secure storage and retrieval of server API keys is implemented and tested.  
    [Source: docs/stories/1.3.story.md]
  - Use abstraction layers for data access; direct DB calls forbidden.  
    [Source: architecture/components.md]
  - Coding standards: Black for formatting, Ruff for linting, PEP 8 style guide.  
    [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Data Models**:  
  - Use the `ServerConfig` Pydantic model for storing server configuration, including the API key.  
    [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

- **API Specifications**:  
  - Use the `/servers/{server_id}/config` endpoint for updating server configuration.  
    [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

- **Component Specifications**:  
  - Use `ServerSettingsManager` for managing server configuration.  
    [Source: architecture/components.md]

- **File Locations**:  
  - Place bot command logic in `packages/bot/`.  
  - Place backend integration logic in `packages/backend/`.  
    [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

- **Testing Requirements**:  
  - Use Pytest for all tests.  
  - Test files should be located alongside bot and backend code or in a dedicated tests directory.  
  - Use guidance found in `architecture/testing-strategy.md.`

- **Technical Constraints**:  
  - Use Python 3.11.  
  - All code must include type hints.  
  - All secrets must be managed via environment variables.  
  - Adhere to security best practices: input validation, no hardcoded secrets, encryption at rest.  
    [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/data-models.md]

- **Project Structure Notes**:  
  - Unified project structure guidance is located at `architecture/unified-project-structure.md`.  
  - Follow the source tree as defined in `architecture/source-tree.md`.

## Testing

- All new code must be covered by unit tests using Pytest.
- Test files should be placed in `packages/bot/tests/` or `packages/backend/tests/`.
- Ensure tests validate command permission checks, secure key submission, and backend integration.
- Follow PEP 8 and Black formatting for all test code.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-31
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation of the server key onboarding command flow is robust and aligns with the architectural and security requirements. The code is well-structured, leverages Pydantic models, and uses type hints throughout. Permission checks are enforced, and error handling is comprehensive. The backend securely encrypts API keys at rest, and no secrets are exposed in logs or messages. The codebase adheres to PEP 8 and Black formatting.

### Refactoring Performed
No major refactoring was required. Minor suggestion: consider extracting repeated error handling logic in the command methods to a shared utility for maintainability.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows PEP 8, Black, and project conventions.
- Project Structure: ✓ Files are placed according to unified project structure.
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Pytest is used, tests are comprehensive and meaningful.
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria are implemented and verified.

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Verified secure storage and encryption of API keys (backend/components/server_settings_manager.py)
- [x] Confirmed permission checks for all commands (bot/cogs/admin_cog.py)
- [x] Validated error and confirmation messages are ephemeral and secure
- [x] Reviewed and confirmed comprehensive test coverage (bot/tests/)
- [x] Extracted error handling logic in command methods to a shared utility (`packages/shared/error_handler.py`), and verified usage in command methods and tests.

### Security Review
- API keys are encrypted at rest using Fernet.
- No secrets are exposed in logs or messages.
- Permission checks prevent unauthorized access.
- No security issues found.

### Performance Considerations
- No performance issues identified. API calls and encryption are handled efficiently.

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done

> Note: All acceptance criteria and tasks are complete. The improvement to centralize error handling logic in a shared utility has been implemented and verified. No outstanding items remain; story is fully complete.
