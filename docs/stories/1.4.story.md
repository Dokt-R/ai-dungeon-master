# Story 1.4: Server Key Onboarding Command Flow

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** server owner,  
**I want** simple commands to set up a shared API key for my server,  
**so that** all members can participate in campaigns using my key.

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)
1. The bot responds to a `/server-setup` command with a message explaining the shared API key model and how to submit a key.
2. The `/server-setup` and `/server-setkey` commands can only be successfully run by users with "Administrator" or "Manage Server" permissions.
3. The bot has a command (e.g., `/server-setkey [API_KEY]`) that accepts the owner's key.
4. When a key is submitted, the bot securely saves it for the entire server using the functionality from Story 1.3.
5. The submitted API key is successfully persisted in the ServerConfig database table for the corresponding server_id.
6. The bot provides a confirmation message upon successful key submission and an error for failures.
7. The owner's submitted key is not visible to other users in the channel.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement `/server-setup` command to explain the shared API key model and submission process.  
  [Source: prd/epic-1-core-bot-platform-user-onboarding.md#story-1.4]
- [ ] Restrict `/server-setup` and `/server-setkey` commands to users with "Administrator" or "Manage Server" permissions.  
  [Source: prd/epic-1-core-bot-platform-user-onboarding.md#story-1.4]
- [ ] Implement `/server-setkey [API_KEY]` command to accept and process the owner's key.  
  [Source: prd/epic-1-core-bot-platform-user-onboarding.md#story-1.4]
- [ ] Integrate with backend to securely store the API key using the ServerConfig model, database table and ServerSettingsManager.
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md, architecture/components.md]
- [ ] Ensure the key is encrypted at rest and never exposed in logs or messages.  
  [Source: architecture/data-models.md, architecture/components.md]
- [ ] Provide confirmation and error messages for key submission.  
  [Source: prd/epic-1-core-bot-platform-user-onboarding.md#story-1.4]
- [ ] Ensure the submitted key is not visible to other users in the channel.  
  [Source: prd/epic-1-core-bot-platform-user-onboarding.md#story-1.4]
- [ ] Write unit tests for all command logic and backend integration.  
  [No specific guidance found in architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- [ ] Document the command flow and security considerations in the README.

## Dev Notes

- **Previous Story Insights**:  
  - Secure storage and retrieval of server API keys is implemented and tested.  
    [Source: docs/stories/1.3.story.md]
  - Use abstraction layers for data access; direct DB calls forbidden.  
    [Source: architecture/components.md]
  - Coding standards: Black for formatting, Ruff for linting, PEP 8 style guide.  
    [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Data Models**:  
  - Use the `ServerConfig` Pydantic model for storing server configuration, including the API key.  
    [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

- **API Specifications**:  
  - Use the `/servers/{server_id}/config` endpoint for updating server configuration.  
    [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

- **Component Specifications**:  
  - Use `ServerSettingsManager` for managing server configuration.  
    [Source: architecture/components.md]

- **File Locations**:  
  - Place bot command logic in `packages/bot/`.  
  - Place backend integration logic in `packages/backend/`.  
    [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

- **Testing Requirements**:  
  - Use Pytest for all tests.  
  - Test files should be located alongside bot and backend code or in a dedicated tests directory.  
  - No specific guidance found in architecture/testing-strategy.md.

- **Technical Constraints**:  
  - Use Python 3.11.  
  - All code must include type hints.  
  - All secrets must be managed via environment variables.  
  - Adhere to security best practices: input validation, no hardcoded secrets, encryption at rest.  
    [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/data-models.md]

- **Project Structure Notes**:  
  - Unified project structure guidance is missing (`unified-project-structure.md` not found).  
  - Follow the source tree as defined in `architecture/source-tree.md`.

## Testing

- All new code must be covered by unit tests using Pytest.
- Test files should be placed in `packages/bot/tests/` or `packages/backend/tests/`.
- Ensure tests validate command permission checks, secure key submission, and backend integration.
- Follow PEP 8 and Black formatting for all test code.
