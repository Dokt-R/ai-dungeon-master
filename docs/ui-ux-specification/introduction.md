# Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and interaction design specifications for the AI D&D DM's user interface. It serves as the foundation for the interaction design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas
The primary user personas are derived from the Project Brief and PRD:
* **The "Hobbyist & Contributor":** A tech-savvy user who values control, customization, and is willing to engage with technical setup (like the BYOK model) for a powerful, free product.
* **The "Convenience Player":** A user who values ease-of-use, a polished experience, and is willing to pay to avoid logistical friction. While the MVP focuses on the Hobbyist, the UX must be simple enough not to alienate this future user.

#### Usability Goals
* **Effortless Onboarding:** A new server owner should be able to set up the bot and start a game in under 15 minutes.
* **Conversational Fluency:** Interactions with the AI should feel natural and conversational, not like rigid, command-line instructions.
* **Immersive Experience:** The interface (the bot's text and voice) must support the narrative and fade into the background, allowing the player to be fully immersed in the story.

#### Design Principles
1.  **Clarity Above All:** The bot's responses, commands, and options must be clear, concise, and unambiguous to prevent player confusion.
2.  **Immersive, Not Intrusive:** The "UI" is the story. All features should serve to enhance the narrative, not interrupt it with complex mechanics.
3.  **Player Agency First:** The interface must empower players to feel in complete control of their characters and their choices, fostering a sense of true TTRPG freedom.
4.  **Consistency is Key:** The way the bot handles commands, presents information, and roleplays NPCs should be consistent and predictable, building trust with the user.
