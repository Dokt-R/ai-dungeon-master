# Component Library / Design System (Minimal Style Guide)

### Design System Approach

Our approach for the MVP is to define a small set of custom formatting rules to ensure a unique brand identity while remaining lightweight.

### Core Formatting Rules & Components

  * **Narrative Titles & Scene Changes:** Use Header 3 Markdown (`###`).
  * **Spoken Dialogue:** Use Block Quote Markdown (`>`).
  * **Proper Nouns & Emphasis:** Use *italics*.
  * **Game Mechanics & Dice Rolls:** Use Inline Code Markdown (`` ` ``).
  * **Out-of-Character System Messages:** Use standard, unformatted text.

### Iconography (Bot Avatar)

The avatar will be a **hooded owl**. The style should be a monochromatic ink drawing of a mysterious, hooded owl figure hunched over a glowing tome.
