# Wireframes & Mockups (Message Design)

For the Discord bot MVP, "wireframes" refer to the design and layout of the bot's key messages and embedded responses. The goal is to present information clearly and attractively within Discord's markdown and embed limitations.

### Dynamic Display Principle: Hide Empty Fields

To maintain a clean and uncluttered interface, fields that are empty, set to zero, or not applicable to the character **should be hidden from view**.

### Key Message Layout: Character Sheet (`/sheet`)

The `/sheet` command will display a comprehensive, multi-page embed. The player will navigate between up to six distinct pages using a row of buttons. Pages or sections that are not relevant (e.g., 'Spellcasting' for a non-spellcaster) will be hidden.
*(This section contains the detailed 6-page character sheet layout defined previously)*
