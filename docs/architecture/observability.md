# Observability

To ensure long-term maintainability and assist in debugging the AI's behavior, the architecture will include:

* **LLM Observability:** Integration with a tracing platform (e.g., LangSmith, LangFuse) to provide detailed, step-by-step traces of the AI's "thought process." This is a foundational task for Epic 1.
* **Campaign Transcript:** A `transcript.log` will be maintained for each campaign, providing a complete, raw record of all player and AI messages for debugging and future summarization features.
