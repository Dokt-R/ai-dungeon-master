# Project Test Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive test strategy for the AI DM project, as defined in the main architecture document. All new code must adhere to these standards.

## 1. Testing Philosophy
* [cite_start]**Approach:** The project will follow a test-after-development approach for the MVP, focusing on ensuring the reliability of our components and their interactions. [cite: 809]
* [cite_start]**Coverage Goals:** A high level of test coverage will be required for all new code before it can be merged. [cite: 809]
* [cite_start]**Test Pyramid:** The focus will be on a strong base of unit tests, supported by a layer of integration tests. [cite: 809]

## 2. Test Types and Organization

### Unit Tests
* [cite_start]**Framework:** We will use **Pytest** for all unit testing. [cite: 810]
* **Scope:** Each individual component and its functions will be tested in isolation. [cite_start]All external dependencies, such as the Discord API, AI provider APIs, and other components, must be mocked. [cite: 811]
* [cite_start]**Location:** Test files will be located in a `tests/` directory within each package (e.g., `packages/backend/tests/`). [cite: 800]

### Integration Tests
* [cite_start]**Scope:** We will write tests to verify that our internal components (e.g., `AIOrchestrator` and `Memory Service`) interact with each other as expected according to the defined API contracts. [cite: 812]
* [cite_start]**Test Infrastructure:** Integration tests may use in-memory versions of dependencies or a dedicated test instance of the SQLite database. [cite: 813]

## 3. Continuous Testing
* [cite_start]**CI Integration:** All tests (unit and integration) will be run automatically via a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) on every pull request to the main branch. [cite: 817]
