# Infrastructure and Deployment

This section defines how the application is packaged, run, and deployed for both local development and production.

## **Containerization using Docker Compose**
The entire application will be managed using Docker and Docker Compose. This ensures a consistent and reproducible environment for all developers and for production. We will maintain two primary configuration files for this purpose: `docker-compose.yml` for development and a separate `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production.

## **Development Environment**
The development environment is optimized for a fast feedback loop with live code reloading.
* **Configuration:** `docker-compose.yml`
* **Mechanism:** This configuration will use **bind mounts** to mirror the local source code from your machine directly into the running containers.
* **Hot Reload:** The services (like the FastAPI backend) will be run with a `--reload` flag. When you save a change to a code file on your machine, the service inside the container will automatically restart to reflect that change instantly.
* **Use Case:** This is for day-to-day development. The only time a developer will need to rebuild the image is when adding or changing dependencies (e.g., in `pyproject.toml`).

## **Production Environment**
The production environment is optimized for stability, security, and performance.
* **Configuration:** `docker-compose.prod.yml`
* **Mechanism:** This configuration will **not** use bind mounts for the source code. Instead, it will run immutable images built from a `Dockerfile`.
* **Dockerfile:** Each service (e.g., in `packages/backend/`) will have its own `Dockerfile`. This file will contain the instructions to `COPY` the source code into the image at build time. This creates a self-contained, stable, and secure artifact for deployment.
* **Use Case:** This is for building the final, official version of the application that would be deployed to a cloud server or distributed to end-users.

## **Deployment Strategy**
* **MVP (Self-Hosted):** The deployment strategy is for a user to clone the repository from GitHub and run it locally for development/use via `docker-compose up`.
* **Post-MVP (Cloud-Hosted):** A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) will use the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.prod.yml` to build, test, and deploy the production-ready application.
