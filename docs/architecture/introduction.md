# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the AI D\&D DM, including the Python backend systems, Discord bot integration, and all supporting services. It serves as the single source of truth for all technical implementation, ensuring a consistent, scalable, and secure application that can be effectively built by developer agents.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

The project will be built from scratch, but will adhere to established best practices and patterns from modern tools.

* **Backend Service:** The structure will follow the patterns of the **FastAPI** framework for a clean, service-oriented design.
* **Discord Bot:** The code will be organized using the **Cogs** pattern, which is the best practice for the `discord.py` library.
